SharpDX Change Log
==================

2011-09-24 Release SharpDX 2.0 Beta
* Major release!
* New APIs for Direct3D9 (not finished yet for Beta but WPF Interop is working), DirectInput, RawInput, XInput, X3DAudio, XACT3, WIC (integrated with Direct2D1).
* New APIs preview for upcomming Win8/DirectX11.1 (D3DCompiler 44, DXGI 1.2, Direct3D11.1, Direct2D1.1) and including support for DirectX Metro application in C#/.Net!
* New Samples (Direct3D10 WPF Interop, Direct3D11 MiniCube, WIC RenderToTarget, WIC EncodeDecode, XAudio2 play XWMA,ADPCM,WAV)
* New 2 Samples for Win8/Metro Preview (MiniCube and port of Win8 C++ DirectX Tutorial)
* NuGet Package available for all SharpDX 2.0 assemblies with symbols (enabling "source step into" debugging)
* Lots of bugfixes, apis simplification and helpers.
* Interop performance slightly improved for method calls.
* Full rewrite of SharpGen, the core technology of SharpDX, a genuine C# code generator directly from C++ Headers using now gccxml. SharpGen is now able to parse all Windows headers!

* Fix [Generator] Less verbose warning when documentation plugin is not available
* New [Generator] New native interop system without using any dynamic assembly. SharpDX interop is faster than previous version, easier to integrate with MonoLinker and Obfuscator.
* New [DirectWrite] New backport from Windows 7.0 SDK of the DirectWrite Custom Layout sample
* New [DirectWrite] ShapingGlyphProperties.Justification is now using enum ScriptJustify
* Issue#10 [Direct3D11 / Direct3D10 ]  Bugfix on missing ImageInformation.FromFile() / FromMemory method.
* Issue#9 [DirectWrite] Various bugfix : TextAnalysisSource methods, GlyphRun marshalling, bitfields support.
* New [DirectWrite] Simplify interfaces TextAnalysisSource/TextAnalyzer. 
* Fix [DirectWrite] Bugfix on DrawGlyphRun, ClientDrawingEffect, easier support for ClientDrawingContext. 
* New [DirectWrite] Added new DirectWrite Color Drawing Effect sample based on Fadi Alsamman initial port. 
* Fix [DirectSound] Bugfix on DirectSound.GetDevices() / DirectSoundCapture.GetDevice() to retrurn all elements
* New [DirectWrite] Added missing method FontFace.GetGlyphRunOutline
* New [DirectWrite] Added FontFace missing property on GlyphRun

2010-12-19 Release SharpDX 1.1
* [Core] Upgrade SharpDX to support .Net Frameworks 2.0 / 3.5 / 4.0
* [Core] Add DataBuffer for read/write random access to unmanaged memory
* [Core] Add DataStream specialized typed Read and Write methods for faster access
* [Core] Bugfix on method DataStream.Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)
* [Core] Add Component class for next Framework infrastructure. Cleanup AssemblyInfo.cs for all SharpDX assemblies. 
* [D3DCompiler] Bugfix on D3D_COMPILE_ENABLE_.* flags that were missing
* [Direct3D10/11] Bugfix mapping correction for Direct3D11/Direct3D10.1 RenderBlendDescription.RenderTargetWriteMask is now using ColorWriteMaskFlags 
* [Direct3D10/11] Bugfix D3D10/11_FILTER enums with correct naming (MIN abbreviation for Minification was wrongly automatically translated to Minimum)
* [Direct3D11] Make Direct3D11.Device.ImmediateContext released when Device is released. 
* [DXGI] Bugfix on DXGI.Output.GetDisplayModeList, failed if no display mode exist for a given mode 
* [DXGI] Bugfix  enum DXGI.Usage to use [Flags].
