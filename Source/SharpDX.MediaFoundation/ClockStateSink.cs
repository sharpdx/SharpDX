        /// This method is called whe the presentation clock's Start method is called, with the following exception: If the clock is paused and Start is called with the value PRESENTATION_CURRENT_POSITION, OnClockRestart is called instead of OnClockStart. The clock notifies the presentation time source by calling the time source's OnClockStart method. This call occurs synchronously within the Start method. If the time source returns an error from OnClockStart, the presentation clock's Start method returns an error and the state change does not take place. For any object that is not the presentation time source, the OnClockStart method is called asynchronously, after the state change is completed. In that case, the return value from this method is ignored. The value given in llClockStartOffset is the presentation time when the clock starts, so it is relative to the start of the presentation. Media sinks should not render any data with a presentation time earlier than llClockStartOffSet. If a sample straddles the offset?that is, if the offset falls between the sample's start and stop times?the sink should either trim the sample so that only data after llClockStartOffset is rendered, or else simply drop the sample.

For any object that is not the presentation time source, the OnClockStop method is called asynchronously, after the state change is completed. If an object is already stopped, it should return Ok from OnClockStop. It should not return an error code. Note??Although the header file mferror.h defines an error code named MF_E_SINK_ALREADYSTOPPED, it should not be returned in this situation.
