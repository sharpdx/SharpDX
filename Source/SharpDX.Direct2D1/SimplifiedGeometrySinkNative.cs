    /// A geometry sink consists of one or more figures. Each figure is made up of one or more line or Bezier curve segments. To create a figure, call the <strong>BeginFigure</strong> method and specify the figure's start point, then use <strong>AddLines</strong> and <strong>AddBeziers</strong> to add line and Bezier segments. When you are finished adding segments, call the <strong>EndFigure</strong> method. You can repeat this sequence to create additional figures. When you are finished creating figures, call the <strong>Close</strong> method. To create geometry paths that can contain arcs and quadratic Bezier curves, use an <strong><see cref="SharpDX.Direct2D1.GeometrySink"/></strong>.
