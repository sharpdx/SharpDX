        /// To write to a Direct3D surface, you obtain an <see cref="SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> and pass it to the {{CreateDxgiSurfaceRenderTarget}} method to create a DXGI surface render target; you can then use the DXGI surface render target to draw 2-D content to the DXGI surface.  A DXGI surface render target is a type of <see cref="SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/>. Like other Direct2D render targets, you can use it to create resources and issue drawing commands. The DXGI surface render target and the DXGI surface must use the same DXGI format. If you specify the {{DXGI_FORMAT_UNKOWN}} format when you create the render target, it will automatically use the surface's format.The DXGI surface render target does not perform DXGI surface synchronization. To work with Direct2D, the Direct3D device that provides the <see cref="SharpDX.DXGI.Surface"/> must be created with the D3D10_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT flag.For more information about creating and using DXGI surface render targets, see the {{Direct2D and Direct3D Interoperability Overview}}.When you create a render target and hardware acceleration is available, you allocate resources on the computer's GPU. By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the render target's {{EndDraw}} method returns the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).

Different implementations of <see cref="SharpDX.Direct2D1.RenderTarget"/> might behave differently when {{BeginDraw}} is called. An <see cref="SharpDX.Direct2D1.BitmapRenderTarget"/> may be locked between BeginDraw/EndDraw calls, a DXGI surface render target might be acquired on BeginDraw and released on EndDraw, while an <see cref="WindowRenderTarget"/> may begin batching at BeginDraw and may present on EndDraw, for example. The BeginDraw method must be called before rendering operations can be called, though state-setting and state-retrieval operations can be performed even outside of {{BeginDraw}}/EndDraw. After {{BeginDraw}} is called, a render target will normally build up a batch of rendering commands, but defer processing of these commands until either an internal buffer is full, the {{Flush}} method is called, or until EndDraw is called. The EndDraw method causes any batched drawing operations to complete, and then returns an HRESULT indicating the success of the operations and, optionally, the tag state of the render target at the time the error occurred. The EndDraw method always succeeds: it should not be called twice even if a previous EndDraw resulted in a failing HRESULT. If EndDraw is called without a matched call to {{BeginDraw}}, it returns an error indicating that BeginDraw must be called before EndDraw. Calling BeginDraw twice on a render target puts the target into an error state where nothing further is drawn, and returns an appropriate HRESULT and error information when EndDraw is called.
