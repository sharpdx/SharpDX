If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.

        /// This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance.

Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible {{formats}}, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently {{mapped}}.   {{Immutable}}, and {{depth-stencil}} resources cannot be used as a destination.  Resources created with {{multisampling capability}} cannot be used as either a source or destination. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See {{performance considerations}} for more details. An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CopySubresourceRegion_"/> instead.   Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1: Direct3D 10.1 enables depth-stencil resources to be used as either a source or destination. Direct3D 10.1 enables multisampled resources to be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if the source is multisampled and the destination is not multisampled (or vice versa), the call to ID3D10Device::CopyResource fails. It is possible to copy between prestructured+typed resources and block-compressed textures. See {{Format Conversion using Direct3D 10.1}}.   ?

        /// The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination location is an absolute value (not a relative value). The destination location can be offset from the source location; however, the size of the region to copy (including the destination location) must fit in the destination resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels.   {{D3D10CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources must meet the following criteria:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same {{type}}. Must have compatible {{formats}} (the formats must either be identical or be from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture because both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently {{mapped}}.  CopySubresourceRegion supports only copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device.CopyResource_"/> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call that the runtime can add  to the command-buffer queue. This asynchronous behavior attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See {{performance considerations}} for more details.   Differences between Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1: Direct3D 10 has the following limitations:  You cannot use a depth-stencil resource as a destination. You cannot use an immutable resource as a destination. You cannot use a multisampled texture as either a source or a destination  Direct3D 10.1 has added support for the following features:  You can use a depth-stencil buffer as a source or a destination. You can use multisampled resources as  source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if the source is multisampled and the destination is not multisampled (or vice versa), the call to ID3D10Device::CopySubresourceRegion fails. You can copy between uncompressed and compressed resources. During copy, the format conversions that are specified in  {{Format Conversion using Direct3D 10.1}} are supported automatically. The uncompressed resource must be at least prestructured, and typed. You must also account for the difference between the virtual and the physical size of the mipmap levels.    ? Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. You must also pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters respectively, must have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a region (130,120),(210,240) in a destination texture. 	
        /// <code> D3D10_BOX sourceRegion;
