        /// Call ID3D10Device::SOSetTargets (before any draw calls) to stream data out; call SOSetTargets with NULL to stop streaming data out. For an example, see Exercise 01 from the GDC 2007 workshop, which sets the stream output render targets before calling draw methods in the RenderInstanceToStream function. An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass. Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The {{DeviceDebug Layer}} will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime. The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device.
