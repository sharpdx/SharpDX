        /// This method is not supported by DXGI 1.0, which shipped in Windows?Vista and Windows Server?2008. DXGI 1.1 support is required, which is available on  Windows?7, Windows Server?2008?R2, and as an update to Windows?Vista with Service Pack?2 (SP2) (KB 971644) and Windows Server?2008 (KB 971512).When you create a factory, the factory enumerates the set of adapters that are available in the system. Therefore, if you change the adapters in a system, you must destroy  and recreate the <see cref="SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/> object. The number of adapters in a system changes when you add or remove a display card, or dock or undock a laptop.When the EnumAdapters1 method succeeds and fills the ppAdapter parameter with the address of the reference to the adapter interface, EnumAdapters1 increments the adapter interface's reference count. When you finish using the  adapter interface, call the Release method to decrement the reference count before you destroy the reference.EnumAdapters1 first returns the local adapter with the output on which the desktop primary is displayed. This adapter corresponds with an index of zero. EnumAdapters1 next returns other adapters with outputs. EnumAdapters1 finally returns adapters without outputs.
