        /// A software adapter is a DLL that implements the entirety of a device driver interface, plus emulation, if necessary, of kernel-mode graphics components for Windows. Details on implementing a software adapter can be found in the Windows Vista Driver Development Kit. This is a very complex development task, and is not recommended for general readers. Calling this method will increment the module's reference count by one. The reference count can be decremented by calling {{FreeLibrary}}. The typical calling scenario is to call {{LoadLibrary}}, pass the handle to CreateSoftwareAdapter, then immediately call {{FreeLibrary}} on the DLL and forget the DLL's {{HMODULE}}. Since the software adapter calls FreeLibrary when it is destroyed, the lifetime of the DLL will now be owned by the adapter, and the application is free of any further consideration of its lifetime.

        /// When you create a factory, the factory enumerates the set of adapters that are available in the system. Therefore, if you change the adapters in a system, you must destroy  and recreate the <see cref="SharpDX.DXGI.Factory"/> object. The number of adapters in a system changes when you add or remove a display card, or dock or undock a laptop.When the EnumAdapters method succeeds and fills the ppAdapter parameter with the address of the reference to the adapter interface, EnumAdapters increments the adapter interface's reference count. When you finish using the  adapter interface, call the Release method to decrement the reference count before you destroy the reference.EnumAdapters first returns the local adapter with the output on which the desktop primary is displayed. This adapter corresponds with an index of zero. EnumAdapters then returns other adapters with outputs.
