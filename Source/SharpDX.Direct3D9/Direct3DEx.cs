        /// <remarks>	
        /// The <see cref="SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> object is the first object that the application creates and the last object that the application releases. Functions for enumerating and retrieving capabilities of a device are accessible through the IDirect3D9Ex object. This enables applications to select devices without creating them.   The <see cref="SharpDX.Direct3D9.Direct3DEx"/> interface supports enumeration of active display adapters and allows the creation of IDirect3D9Ex objects. If the user dynamically adds adapters (either by adding devices to the desktop, or by hot-docking a laptop), these devices are not included in the enumeration. Creating a new IDirect3D9Ex interface will expose the new devices.   Pass the D3D_SDK_VERSION flag to this function to ensure that header files used in the compiled application match the version of the installed runtime DLLs. D3D_SDK_VERSION is changed in the runtime only when a header or another code change would require rebuilding the application. If this function fails, it indicates that the versions of the header file and the runtime DLL do not match.  Note??Direct3DCreate9Ex is supported only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7.   Earlier versions of the D3D9.dll library do not include Direct3D9Ex and Direct3DCreate9Ex.
